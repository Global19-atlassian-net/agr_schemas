## Branches

### master

This branch is the stable branch that is used for creating releases. In order to create a release the developer should make sure all changes are pushed to the branch and then create a tag.

### develop

Changes should not be made directly to this branch. Changes in the branch are intended to, when ready, be merged into the master branch. Contributions to this branch should be done through a feature branch.

### feature branches

In order to contribute a new feature or to fix a bug follow the following rules of thumb:

- Create a new branch from `develop`.
     * Use the naming convention `feature/<relevant name>`.
     * Make sure the name of the branch reflects the work being done on the branch.
     * If creating the branch locally, make sure to push the branch to GitHub.
- Once the branch has been created, associate a github issue with the branch and assign a the developer to the issue.
     * Please create an issue if one does not exist.
- Once the feature is deemed ready, a pull request should be created and used to pull the changes into develop.
