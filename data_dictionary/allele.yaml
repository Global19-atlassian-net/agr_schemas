id: "Allele"
title: Allele
type: object
description: > One of multiple possible forms of a functional genomic element (most often described as a locus or a gene), 
differing from the reference DNA sequence. The genomic element can be endogenous or constructed.

Associated data: Is allele of: gene/locus/genomic element; 
Contains: variant(s)

Notes: The change(s) present in a given allele is effectively described by genomic Variant(s). At the Alliance, “allele” refers to a form of a 
functional genomic element. Functional genomic element is a section of DNA with known (e.g. gene, regulatory sequence), 
or unknown function (e.g. conserved region with unknown function). Functional genomic element also includes constructs 
which were inserted anywhere in the genome. An allele can refer to a functional element/locus present in the nuclear or in the organellar genome.
